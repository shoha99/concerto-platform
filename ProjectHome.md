# Contribute to the Concerto project! #

We are only a small team of core members, and consequently are always happy to have help from the larger Concerto community. You can contribute to the project in various ways, including:

  * Translations - Translate the Concerto dictionary file so that the platform can be available in a new language. Concerto is currently available in English, Polish, Chinese (simplified), German, French and Bulgarian.
  * Tutorials - Develop a written, audio or video tutorial on developing a test in Concerto, adding special features to your test, or something new that relates to Concerto. Take a look at the available tutorials to get an idea or come up with your own innovative ideas.
  * Funding - If you do not want to directly work on the project, your monetary contributions can help us hire others with the necessary skills and time.
Get in touch with any other ideas you have.
  * Software development - There are various ways you can help, if you have programming skills. Opt for one of the suggestions below or get in touch with us to discuss more options.
  * Platform development - Help develop the next version of the platform, plug-ins etc. This requires intermediate-advanced knowledge of computer programming.
  * Debugging and benchmarking - Even if you have beginner-intermediate knowledge of programming you can still help. Help check the work of our programmers, identify errors/bugs and other limitations that can be improved in the developmental version, and make recommendations concerning the layout and wording of our help and example pages..
  * Templates and Style Sheets - Develop different kinds of style sheets and/or HTML templates that Concerto users can download from the object library.

Remember, you can work remotely or on-site, and full-time, part-time or in your own time. Students are also welcome to join us for summer internships and work placements. [Get in touch with us today!](mailto:contact@psychometrics.cam.ac.uk?Subject=Contributing%20to%20Concerto&cc=vm298@cam.ac.uk)
