Dear {name},

We have now set up demo installation of Concerto on our server so you can try it out without installing it on your own machine. We have used the latest release of Concerto and we will keep updating it regularly.

This is a free and open-source software and we welcome collaboration and support from its users. You may consider helping us to translate the GUI to your native language, reporting problems, correcting  mistakes in our current GUI, expanding or improving user's manual and tutorial, suggesting new features.

Please DO NOT share your login credentials with anyone. Note that you do not have access to Rstudio and user's tab, but we gave you full access to the R and MySQL engines. We kindly ask you to not overuse the resources of this server by running computation heavy R scripts and/or MySQL queries, e.g. for performance testing purposes. Please note, that you can run such tests after installing Concerto on your own machine.

Demo installation of the Concerto platform:
